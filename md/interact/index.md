# Interact

There are many ways to interact and get involved with Crypto.is and the various anonymity projects out there.

### Contribution Wishlist

We maintain a list of interesting projects The Crypto Project thinks would be worthwhile for people to work on, promote, and develop at the [Contribution Wishlist](/interact/wishlist/). These are the areas members need help with, services we believe should be setup, and more.

### Mailing Lists

Crypto.is has its own mailing list, and there are [a number of additional mailing lists for other anonymity projects](/interact/mailing_lists/) you can join to keep tabs on development.

### Chat on IRC

Join in on the conversation on the #cryptodotis channel on OFTC. Most of The Crypto Project conversation goes on there as well as conversation related to various projects .

### Donate Your Time

Are you a developer? Can you write documentation? The Crypto Project is looking for anyone that can contribute to a project in anyway. Check out [Contributing Time](/interact/time/) for more information.

### Fund Anonymity Servers

To donate funds to The Crypto Project, or to find information to donate to the
various supported projects, check out [Contributing Money][2]

### Contribute Servers, Shares and Bandwidth

One of the best ways to help out anonymity projects is to set up and run a
server yourself. The Crypto Projects aims to create a master set of tutorials
and guides for all who are looking to set up servers. Check out [Contributing
Goods][3] to find links to more information on how you can help.

Something any anonymity networks needs... is the network.  If you can donate servers, space, or bandwidth we can help you put it to good use.  Check out [Contributing Goods](/interact/goods/) or [get in touch](/about/).
