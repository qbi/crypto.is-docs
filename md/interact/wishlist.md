# Contribution Wishlist

This page is intended to be a list of interesting projects The Crypto Project thinks would be worthwhile for people to work on, promote, and develop - either under the banner of The Crypto Project or not. This list also includes services that need to be setup.

## Guides

 - A walkthough of [TLS](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054)-[SRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS-SRP) including diagrams of how it works, [why it's better than alternatives](http://rdist.root.org/2010/09/08/clench-is-inferior-to-tlssrp/), and [how to set it up](/projects/bleeding/) on a server.
 - A survey of different cipher modes (ECB, CBC, ...), especially the more exotic ones, and what one would want to use for specific purposes.

## Bugfixes

- Reportedly, in pidgin-OTR and irssi-OTR "The /me command gets sent in the clear. Use /say /me instead; a Pidgin-using recipient will display that like /me."

## Software

- Proper GPG plugins for both Firefox and Chrome - cf. [FireGPG](http://getfiregpg.org/s/home)
- More Varied Convergence backends: CA Validating, DNSSEC Validating, OCSP, CRL, EFF Observatory, [Google Cert Observatory](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/04/improving-ssl-certificate-security.html), CA Pinned Validator
- Help with the [Pynchon Gate](https://github.com/nmathewson/pynchon-gate)
- Bring [FireOTR](https://www.gitorious.org/fireotr/fireotr) from proof of concept to general usability - see also the Pending Pickup section at the [Code Clearing House](https://crypto.is/projects/cch/)

## Services

- Mixminion exit nodes.
